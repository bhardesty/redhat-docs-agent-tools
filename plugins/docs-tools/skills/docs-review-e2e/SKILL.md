# End-to-End Documentation Review

A unified multi-agent documentation review with confidence-based scoring and optional code-aware technical validation.

## Modes

| Arguments | Mode | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `--local` | Local review | Review doc changes in current branch vs base branch |
| `--pr <url>` | PR/MR review | Review doc changes in a GitHub PR or GitLab MR |
| `--pr <url> --post-comments` | PR/MR + post | Review and post inline comments to PR/MR |
| `--action-comments [url]` | Action comments | Fetch and interactively action unresolved PR/MR review comments (auto-detects PR if URL omitted) |
| *(no arguments)* | Error | Display usage |

## Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--threshold <0-100>` | Confidence threshold for reporting issues (default: 80) |
| `--code <url>` | Code repository URL for technical validation (repeatable). Enables Agent 5. |
| `--fix` | Auto-fix high-confidence issues (>=65%), then interactively walk through remaining |

If no arguments are provided, display usage and ask the user to specify a mode.

## Agent Assumptions

These apply to ALL agents and subagents:

- All tools are functional. Do not test tools or make exploratory calls.
- Only call a tool if required. Every tool call should have a clear purpose.
- The confidence threshold is 80 by default (adjustable with `--threshold`).

# Multi-Agent Review Pipeline

The `--local` and `--pr` modes share the same pipeline. The difference is how files are discovered and how results are delivered.

## Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

### For --pr mode

Launch a haiku agent to check if any of the following are true:
- The pull request is closed
- The pull request is a draft
- The pull request does not need documentation review (e.g. automated PR, code-only change with no .adoc or .md files)
- Claude has already commented on this PR (check `gh pr view <PR> --comments` for comments left by claude)

If any condition is true, stop. Still review Claude-generated PRs.

### For --local mode

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main; then
    BASE_BRANCH="main"
elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master; then
    BASE_BRANCH="master"
else
    echo "ERROR: No main or master branch found"; exit 1
fi
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Currently on $BASE_BRANCH. Switch to a feature branch first."; exit 1
fi
```

## Step 2: Discover Documentation Files

### For --local mode

```bash
git diff --name-only "$BASE_BRANCH"...HEAD > /tmp/docs-review-all-files.txt
git diff --name-only HEAD >> /tmp/docs-review-all-files.txt
git diff --name-only --cached >> /tmp/docs-review-all-files.txt
sort -u /tmp/docs-review-all-files.txt | grep -E '\.(adoc|md)$' > /tmp/docs-review-doc-files.txt || true
DOC_FILES=$(wc -l < /tmp/docs-review-doc-files.txt)
```

### For --pr mode

Use `docs-tools:git-pr-reader` to get changed files:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py files "${PR_URL}" --json | \
    python3 -c "import json,sys; files=[f['path'] for f in json.load(sys.stdin) if f['path'].endswith(('.adoc','.md'))]; print('\n'.join(files))" > /tmp/docs-review-doc-files.txt
```

### For both modes

If no documentation files found, report and exit.

## Step 3: Summarize Changes

Launch a sonnet agent to view changes and return a summary noting:
- Which files are new vs modified
- Whether files appear to be concepts, procedures, references, or assemblies
- Any structural patterns (modular docs, release notes)

For `--pr` mode: `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py diff "${PR_URL}"`
For `--local` mode: `git diff "$BASE_BRANCH"...HEAD -- $(cat /tmp/docs-review-doc-files.txt)`

## Step 4: Multi-Agent Parallel Review

Launch agents in parallel. Each agent returns issues with: `file`, `line`, `description`, `reason`, `confidence` (0-100), `severity` (error/warning/suggestion).

For `--pr` mode, use `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py extract` for deterministic line numbers.

**Important**: The agent files describe a JIRA-based drafts workflow for standalone use. In this context, ignore JIRA/drafts sections — review changed files from the diff and return issues in the format above.

### Agent 1: Style guide compliance (batch A)

- `subagent_type`: `docs-tools:docs-reviewer`

Focus on: `docs-tools:ibm-sg-language-and-grammar`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-punctuation`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-structure-and-format`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-technical-elements`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-grammar-and-language`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-formatting`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-structure`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-technical-examples`

### Agent 2: Style guide compliance (batch B)

- `subagent_type`: `docs-tools:docs-reviewer`

Focus on: `docs-tools:ibm-sg-audience-and-medium`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-numbers-and-measurement`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-references`, `docs-tools:ibm-sg-legal-information`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-gui-and-links`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-legal-and-support`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-accessibility`, `docs-tools:rh-ssg-release-notes`

### Agent 3: Modular docs structure and content quality

- `subagent_type`: `docs-tools:docs-reviewer`

Focus on: `docs-tools:docs-review-modular-docs`, `docs-tools:docs-review-content-quality`. Run Vale once per file if available.

### Agent 4: Technical accuracy and consistency

- `subagent_type`: `docs-tools:technical-reviewer`
- `model`: `opus`

Follow the full technical review process: doc type detection, reviewer persona (developer/architect lens), 6 review dimensions, confidence scoring, and output format. Use `docs-tools:jira-reader`, `docs-tools:git-pr-reader`, and `docs-tools:article-extractor` to cross-check technical claims. Do not duplicate style or formatting checks.

### Agent 5: Code-aware technical scan (conditional)

**Only runs when**: `--code <url>` is provided, or code repos can be auto-discovered from the PR URL, JIRA ticket context, or `:code-repo-url:` AsciiDoc attributes in the changed files.

**Dispatched as**: a general-purpose agent.

Workflow:

1. **Clone repos** to `/tmp/tech-review/<repo-name>/` using `git clone` (full history, not `--depth 1` — `git log` search needs history). Try specified ref, fall back to default branch.

2. **Extract references** from doc files:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/code_scanner.py extract $(cat /tmp/docs-review-doc-files.txt) --output /tmp/tech-review-refs.json
   ```

3. **Search repos** for evidence:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/code_scanner.py search /tmp/tech-review-refs.json /tmp/tech-review/repo1 [repo2...] --output /tmp/tech-review-search.json
   ```

4. Return the search results JSON for structured triage in Step 5.

### Signal quality filter

**Flag issues where:**
- Documentation will actively mislead users (wrong commands, broken examples, incorrect terminology)
- Required modular docs structure is missing or incorrect
- Clear, unambiguous style guide violations with a citable rule
- Accessibility failures (missing alt text, inaccessible tables)

**Do NOT flag:**
- Minor stylistic preferences that don't affect clarity
- Potential issues depending on context outside changed files
- Subjective wording suggestions unless they violate a specific rule
- Pre-existing issues in unchanged content

Do NOT flag (false positives):
- Pre-existing issues in unchanged content
- Something that appears to be a style violation but is an accepted project convention
- Pedantic nitpicks that a senior technical writer would not flag
- Issues that Vale will catch automatically (do not run Vale to verify unless the agent has Vale available)
- General quality concerns (e.g., "could be more concise") unless they violate a specific rule
- Style suggestions that conflict with existing content in the same document
- Terminology that matches the product's official naming even if it differs from the style guide
- Minor stylistic preferences that don't affect clarity
- Potential issues that depend on context outside the changed files
- Subjective wording suggestions unless they violate a specific style rule

## Step 5: Structured Triage (Agent 5 results only)

Process ALL search results from Agent 5 through a deterministic classification pipeline. A command can be `found: true` but still have stale flags.

**Pass 1: Scope filtering (commands only)** — Check `scope` field:
- `scope: external` → Tag `out-of-scope`, skip. These are system commands that cannot be validated against the code repo.
- `scope: in-scope` or `unknown` → Continue to Pass 2.
- Non-command categories always proceed to Pass 2.

**Pass 2: Deterministic validation**:
- **Commands with `cli_validation`**: If `unknown_flags` is non-empty, flag each. Confidence >=80%.
- **Configs with `schema_validation`**: If `keys_only_in_doc` exists, flag as potentially stale/renamed. Confidence 70-85% based on `overlap_ratio`.
- **File paths with `found: false`**: Basename matches → likely moved (70-80%). No matches → low confidence (<50%).

**Pass 3: Evidence-based analysis** — For items not resolved by Pass 2:
- `git_evidence` of renames/deprecation → 70-90% confidence.
- Partial matches → 50-64% confidence.
- No matches, no evidence → <50% confidence.

**Pass 4: Read source files** — For items flagged in passes 2-3 with confidence >=50%, read the actual source file to confirm the issue.

**Severity**: `High` = users will hit errors. `Medium` = misleading but not blocking. `Low` = cosmetic.

## Step 6: Validate Issues

For each issue from Steps 4-5, launch parallel subagents to validate:
- Missing short description → verify `[role="_abstract"]` is actually absent
- Style violation → confirm the specific rule applies and text truly violates it
- Broken cross-reference → verify the target doesn't exist
- Terminology error → check it's not an acceptable variant

Use opus subagents for structural/technical issues, sonnet for style violations.

## Step 7: Filter Issues

Remove issues that:
- Were not validated in Step 6
- Score below the confidence threshold (default: 80)

## Step 8: Whole-Repo Anti-Pattern Scan (conditional)

**Only runs when Agent 5 ran.** Catches issues extraction+search may miss.

**Scan scope**: `.adoc` and `.md` files in the parent directories of `--docs` sources.

**8a: Anti-pattern scan** — Use discovered CLI definitions and schemas:
1. For each `cli_validation.unknown_flags` from Step 5, search for additional occurrences
2. For each `schema_validation.keys_only_in_doc`, search for additional occurrences
3. If code repo entry point name differs from docs, scan for old name

**8b: Blast radius scan** — For each issue from Step 5, search the doc tree for additional occurrences. Record every file and line.

## Step 9: Generate Report and Present Results

Write report to `/tmp/docs-review-report.md` using the format below. Output summary to terminal:

```
## Documentation Review

**Source**: <branch vs base | PR/MR URL>
**Files reviewed**: X documentation files
**Issues found**: Y (Z above confidence threshold)

### Issues

1. **file.adoc:15** [confidence: 92] — Missing `:_mod-docs-content-type:` attribute (modular-docs)
2. **file.adoc:42** [confidence: 85] — Use "data center" not "datacenter" (RedHat.TermsErrors)

### Skipped (below threshold)

- **file.adoc:55** [confidence: 60] — Consider using active voice

Full report saved to: /tmp/docs-review-report.md
```

### For --local mode: Offer to Apply Changes

After the summary, offer to apply fixes for errors. Describe suggestions but let the user decide.

### For --pr mode without --post-comments

Stop here.

### For --pr mode with --post-comments

If NO issues found, post a summary comment via `gh pr comment`:

> ## Documentation review
> No issues found. Checked for style guide compliance, modular docs structure, content quality, and technical accuracy.
> RHAI docs Claude Code review

If issues found, continue to Step 10.

## Step 10: Post Inline Comments (--post-comments only)

Get deterministic line numbers:
```bash
LINE=$(python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py extract "${PR_URL}" "path/to/file.adoc" "pattern from the issue")
```

Build comments JSON and post:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py post "${PR_URL}" /tmp/docs-review-comments.json
```

For each comment: brief description with style guide rule, include corrected text for small fixes, describe larger fixes without inline code. **Only ONE comment per unique issue.**

## Step 10a: Fix Mode (--fix only)

**Phase A — Auto-fix**: For each issue with confidence >=65%, apply the fix using the Edit tool.

**Phase B — Interactive walkthrough**: For each issue with confidence <65%, present to user:

```
Issue 1 of 5: Command flag renamed | Confidence: 60% | Severity: High
File: modules/proc-install.adoc

Current:   $ my-tool --enable-feature
Suggested: $ my-tool --feature-enable

Evidence: Flag renamed in commit abc123
```

Ask user via AskUserQuestion: **Apply** | **Modify** | **Skip** | **Delete section**

# Mode: --action-comments

Fetch unresolved review comments from GitHub PRs or GitLab MRs and interactively action them.

## Step 1: Resolve PR/MR URL

If URL provided, use directly. If omitted, auto-detect:
```bash
PR_URL=$(python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py detect 2>/dev/null)
```

## Step 2: Fetch Unresolved Comments

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py comments "${PR_URL}" --json
```

The script automatically filters bot comments, resolved threads, and returns top-level comments only with: `id`, `path`, `line`, `body`, `author`, `resolved`.

## Step 3: Process Each Comment Interactively

For each unresolved comment, present:

```markdown
## Comment from @{author} on `{file_path}:{line}`

> {comment_body}

### Current Content
{relevant lines from the file}

### Suggested Change
{analysis and proposed change}
```

Ask user via AskUserQuestion: **Apply** | **Edit** | **Skip** | **View context**

When approved: Read target file, apply Edit, confirm, move to next.

## Step 4: Summary

```markdown
## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total comments | X |
| Comments addressed | Y |
| Comments skipped | Z |
| Bot comments filtered | N |
```

Categorize comments: **Required** (style violations, errors — must fix), **Suggestion** (improvements — user discretion), **Question** (needs discussion), **Outdated** (already addressed — skip).

*Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)*
```

**Sections**: Errors = must fix. Warnings = should fix. Suggestions = optional.

**Do NOT include**: positive findings, executive summaries, compliance percentages, references sections.

## Feedback Guidelines

- **In scope**: Content changed in the branch or PR/MR. **Out of scope**: Unchanged content, enhancement requests.
- **Required** (blocks merging): Typos, modular docs violations, style guide violations.
- **Optional** (does not block): Wording improvements, reorganization, stylistic preferences. Mark with **[SUGGESTION]**.
- Cite specific style guide rules. Use softening language for suggestions. For recurring issues: "[GLOBAL] This issue occurs elsewhere."

# Notes

- Always use `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/git-pr-reader/scripts/git_pr_reader.py` for all Git platform interactions (see `docs-tools:git-pr-reader` for full API reference)
- Always use `git_pr_reader.py extract` for deterministic line numbers — never estimate or guess
- Use Bash with heredoc/cat for writing /tmp files (not the Write tool)
- Cite the specific style guide rule or review skill for each issue
- Comments are posted under YOUR username using tokens from `~/.env`
- For .adoc files, modular docs compliance uses `docs-tools:docs-review-modular-docs`
- Release notes skills only apply to .adoc files that appear to be release notes
- Vale linting requires Vale to be installed and configured
